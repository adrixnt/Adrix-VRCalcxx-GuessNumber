# Adrix-VRCalcxx-GuessNumber
Vincent Radio {Adrix.NT} :: VRCalc++ OOSL :: Guess a Number in range

this is a small VRCalc++ Guess Number console script that lets the user ...
- set the max number to guess (starting from 0)
- play the game

the number of tries left to the user is based upon the max number

it also shows ...
- the number of tries left
- the previous guesses

it is made up of 1 VRCalc++ .vrc file (you can also find it into the zipped file)
